# Reply As Original Recipient

Thunderbird extension. This Thunderbird extension automatically changes the From: field in replies to whatever the original senderâ€™s email had in To:, but only if there is a + in the email and there is only one address in To:.

To "compile" this into an extension ready to use in Thunderbird, zip everything up (you don't need the README.md or the LICENSE though) and change the .zip extension to .xpi.
Example:
```
git clone https://github.com/qiqitori/reply_as_original_recipient.git
cd reply_as_original_recipient
zip -r * ../reply_as_original_recipient.xpi
```

## Changes since Version 1.2

### Multiple "To:" entries
The extension will still work when there are multiple "To:" entries, as long as only one entry has a plus sign (or matches the patterns, see below)

### "Cc:"
"To:" and "Cc:" are both used to find the Recipient. This makes senece now that only exactly one match is alowed.

### Configurable patterns:
The option "use_plus" is replaced by "extensions.replyasoriginalrecipient.patterns".

#### Example of patterns:
- `name+*@gmail.com` (Thx @Yves for the idea)
- `*@example.org`
- `*+*` (the default)
- `*` (same behaviour as "use_plus" set to false in version 1.1)
- `*@example.org,*+*` (multiple patterns are separated by comma)

The patterns are matched case insensitive against the full recipient e.g. `My Name <my.name@example.com>` as well as the email (the part between `<` and `>`).  
Only `*` and `,` have special meaning in the patterns option.  
Blanks at the beginning and the end are ignored.
